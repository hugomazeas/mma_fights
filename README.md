# MMA FIGHTS
My first attempt to make a 100% single page web application. This application will be used to register data from MMA Fights including hits by each fighter and controle time in order to pull
interesting statistics from fights, fighter individually or strategy in general. 
# Work in progress
This project is a two-step project. The first: building the platform and mechanism to feed the database. The second: extract statistics from the database to observe patterns from fighters and career-wide statistics like takedown accuracy, takedown defense accuracy, jab, hook and uppercut accuracy. 
I am currently developping the platform, more specifically on the mechanism to collect fight data the most efficient way possible. 
# Run this app
To run this app, pull the project locally and execute
```bash
npm run start
 ```
**Database schema file coming soon!!**
